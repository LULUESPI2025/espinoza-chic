# Reflection: Espinoza Chic Website Project

## Which AI tool(s) did you use?

I used **ChatGPT** by OpenAI to assist with generating HTML and CSS code for my landing page project. Specifically, I used ChatGPT for layout structure, styling suggestions, and animation guidance.

## How did it help you?

ChatGPT helped me:
- Build a complete layout with all the required sections (hero, about, services, contact, footer)
- Create a responsive three-column design using Flexbox
- Style the website with a soft aesthetic using a beige-pink-purple color palette
- Add a subtle side-to-side animation for the brand name
- Comment on which sections were AI-generated as part of the requirement

## What challenges did you encounter?

- Ensuring that the CSS was clean and readable while still visually appealing
- Customizing and editing the AI-generated content to better match the brand tone and requirements
- Making sure the design remained responsive on smaller screens

## What did you learn overall about using AI for coding?

Using AI tools like ChatGPT is extremely helpful for speeding up development and improving the quality of web designs. It provides instant suggestions and helps generate complete sections of code with clear explanations. However, it's important to still understand the code yourself so you can modify and debug it as needed.

I learned that AI is an excellent assistant, especially for front-end work, but it's best used in collaboration with my own design goals and creativity.
